# Throw-away project

TO DO LIST (as of 10/17/2016):

1. Learn how to precisely-ish work with the accelerometer
  1. Should it be calibrated first? So far, I belive it should.
  2. Implement the calibration as a function that can be called through the Andoid App before the first throw.

2. Work out the physics involved in the throw motion.
   1. ~~How to measure the overal force of the throw?~~ DONE
   2. ~~Determine what should be sent through BLE.~~ DONE
